# Oh, you need "RAPID" prototyping too?

## Who is allowed what? Never write controllers.
"Admins may edit posts, but guests can only view them." Tell model so, requests are restricted and action buttons are generated on views.

## Every files are recognized, by fallback.
Anything can be contain in your package. Sure, core files too.

## Wanna write specifications? Sorry. It's readied.
CRUD matrices are generated automaticaly from models and configs. Why don't you hit keys first?
